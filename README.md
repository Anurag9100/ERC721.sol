# ERC721.sol
Project Title: ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Smart Contract
Description:

Developed a blockchain-based Non-Fungible Token (NFT) system using the ERC-721 standard on the Ethereum blockchain. The project involves creating unique, verifiable digital assets (NFTs) that can represent ownership of digital or physical items such as art, music, collectibles, or certificates. Each token is distinct and cannot be replaced or divided, ensuring true digital scarcity and authenticity.

Key Features:

Unique Token Creation: Each NFT has a unique token ID and metadata (name, description, image, etc.).

Metadata Storage: Integrated with IPFS or local storage to securely store and reference NFT metadata.

Minting Functionality: Allows the contract owner to mint new NFTs and assign them to specific Ethereum addresses.

Ownership Tracking: Uses blockchain’s transparency to verify current and historical ownership of each token.

Secure Transfers: Enables secure transfer of tokens between users while preventing duplication.

Smart Contract Implementation: Built using Solidity with OpenZeppelin’s ERC-721 library for standard compliance.

Technologies Used:

Blockchain Platform: Ethereum

Programming Language: Solidity

Smart Contract Library: OpenZeppelin ERC-721

Tools: Remix IDE / Hardhat / MetaMask

Storage (optional): IPFS for metadata and images

Outcome:

Successfully deployed a decentralized NFT smart contract that demonstrates the concept of digital ownership and uniqueness, applicable to domains like art marketplaces, gaming assets, and supply chain certificates.
